# Write a Python program that demonstrates the correct use of indentation, comments, and
# variables following PEP 8 guidelines.

# This program calculates the area of a rectangle
# and displays it using proper PEP 8 formatting

# Define the length and width of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area (length Ã— width)
area = length * width

# Display the result
print("Length:", length)
print("Width:", width)
print("Area of the rectangle is:", area)
