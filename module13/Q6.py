# Write a Python program to find greater and less than a number using
#  if_else.?

# Program to compare two numbers using if-else

# Take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Compare the numbers
if num1 > num2:
    print("The first number is greater than the second number.")
elif num1 < num2:
    print("The first number is less than the second number.")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal.")
