THEORY :-


Q1*  Understanding how to create and access elements in a list.


>  Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

> Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.


Q2*  Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).


> 1. Positive Indexing
Starts from 0.

The first element is at index 0, second at 1, and so on.

> 2. Negative Indexing
Starts from -1 (last element).

Helps to access elements from the end of the list.


Q3*  Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.


>Slicing is used to access a range of elements from a list by specifying a start, stop, and step.

> numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

print(numbers[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]



Q4* Sorting and reversing a list using sort(), sorted(), and reverse()
