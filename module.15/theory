Q1. Introduction to the print() function in Python.

-> The print() function in Python is used to display output on the console. 
It's one of the most commonly used functions in any Python program.


Q2. Formatting outputs using f-strings and format().

-> When you want to print variables or values in a structured, readable way, 
Python gives you two great tools.


Q3. Using the input() function to read user input from the keyboard.

-> The input() function is used to take input from the user via the keyboard. 
Whatever the user types is returned as a string.


Q4. Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').

->  "r"       Read only
    "w"       write only
    "a"       Append
    "r+"      read+ write
    "w+"      write+read


Q5. Using the open() function to create and access files.

-> The open() function is the gateway to file handling in Python. You use it to create, read, write, or append files.


Q6.  Closing files using close().

-> When you work with files in Python, itâ€™s important to close them  properly after you're done. This ensures that:
    Data is saved to the disk correctly,
    System resources are freed,
    File locks (if any) are released.


Q7. Reading from a file using read(), readline(), readlines()

-> read():- Reads all contents of a file as a single string
-> readline():- Reads only one line at a time. Useful in loops
-> readlines():- Reads all lines and returns a list where each item is a line.


Q8. Writing to a file using write() and writelines().

-> Write(): - Writes one string to a file.
You must manually add newline characters (\n) if needed.
-> writelines(): - Writes a list of strings to a file.
Does not automatically add \n, so include them in the lis
